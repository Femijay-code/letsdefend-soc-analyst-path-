# 🛡️ Module 1: SOC Fundamentals  
*Let’s Define SOC Analyst Learning Path*

## 📘 Overview
This module introduces the structure, goals, and roles of a modern Security Operations Center (SOC). It explains how SOC teams operate, what tools they use, and how analysts respond to alerts and incidents.

## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

- **What is a SOC:**  
  A Security Operations Center is a centralized facility where cybersecurity professionals monitor, detect, and respond to security threats using technology and processes.

- **Types of SOC Models:**  
  - In-House SOC  
  - Virtual SOC  
  - Co-Managed SOC  
  - Command SOC

- **SOC Analyst Role:**  
  The SOC Analyst is the first line of defense. They monitor alerts in SIEMs, investigate them using EDR and SOAR tools, and escalate confirmed threats.

- **Key Tools Used in SOCs:**  
  - SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)  
  - EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)  
  - SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)  
  - Log correlation systems

## 🛠️ Terms & Technologies Covered

- **SIEM** — Used to collect and analyze logs  
- **EDR** — Endpoint visibility and detection  
- **SOAR** — Automates incident response  
- **TTP** — Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used by attackers  
- **Log Correlation** — Combining multiple logs to detect patterns

## ✍️ Reflections
Many of the tools and techniques discussed here were familiar to me through my existing hands-on work with Wireshark, Splunk, and Windows Event Logs.
